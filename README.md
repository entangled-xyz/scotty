*"Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done."*â€”Montgomery Scott

Scotty is a quantum computing framework for Scala developers. It comes with a quantum computer simulator that can be used for writing hybrid programs.

Most quantum frameworks and simulators are written either in quantum-specific languages or Python. Scotty is one of the first attempts to build a cross-platform quantum framework on top of the JVM.

It was created with three principles in mind:

- **Write once, run anywhere**: experiment with quantum code and run it with Scotty. Compile it (coming soon) to Quil or OpenQASM and run it on other simulators or real quantum computers.
- **Expandability**: provide a high-level set of abstractions that can be expanded to different architectures.
- **No PhD required**: it should be easy to get started and everything should work out-of-the-box.

Here is an example of a quantum teleportation algorithm written in Scotty to give you an idea of what a typical piece of code looks like:

```scala
implicit val random = new Random()

def bellPair(q1: Int, q2: Int) = Circuit(H(q1), CNOT(q1, q2))

val msg = Qubit(Complex(0.8), Complex(0.6))

val circuit = bellPair(1, 2)
  .combine(Circuit(CNOT(0, 1), H(0)))
  .combine(CNOT(1, 2), Controlled(0, Z(2)))
  .withRegister(msg, Qubit.zero("here"), Qubit.zero("there"))

QuantumSimulator().run(circuit) match {
  case s: Superposition => assert(QubitProbabilityReader(s).read("there")
    .forall(q => q.probability == Math.pow(msg.b.abs, 2)))
}
```

Here we setup a quantum circuit with a custom register of qubits, run it on the quantum simulator, and then peek at the *superposition* probability of the "there" qubit.
